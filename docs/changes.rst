Change log
----------

Version 0.19.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released: not yet

**Incompatible changes:**

* The ``lpar deactivate`` command is now non-forceful by default, but
  can be made to behave like previously by specifying the new ``--force``
  option. In force mode, the deactivation operation is permitted when the
  LPAR status is "operating".

**Deprecations:**

**Bug fixes:**

**Enhancements:**

* Fixes and improvements in Makefile.

* Added initial set of function tests for zhmc command.

* Improved the table output of complex properties (arrays or nested objects),
  to use nested tables, where possible. See issue #9.

* Added support for a ``--force`` option in the ``lpar activate``,
  ``lpar deactivate``, and ``lpar load`` commands. It controls whether
  the operation is permitted when the LPAR status is "operating".

  Note that this changes ``lpar deactivate`` to be non-forceful by default
  (force=True was hard coded for deactivate, before this change).

* Added support for a ``--activation-profile-name`` option in LPAR activate.

* Added support for ``cpc set-power'save``, ``cp set-power-capping``
  and ``cpc get-em-data`` operations.

- Improved support for logging to the system log in zhmccli.py:
  Added support for retrying multiple addresses if creating a Python system
  log handler fails. Added localhost:514 as a second choice for Linux and
  OS-X. This fixes the system log issue on the Travis CI with Ubuntu 14.04
  (Issue 35). Added support for system log in CygWin, using /dev/log and
  localhost:514 as the addresses to try.

- Removed the assertions in zhmccli.reset_logger() that verified
  the result of resetting the log handlers. It turned out that recently,
  a log capture logger is present that is caused by the test environment.
  These assertions were probably a bit overkill anyway (Issue #35).

**Known issues:**

* See `list of open issues`_.

Version 0.18.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released: 2017-10-19

This is the base version for this change log. The zhmccli project was
split off of the python-zhmcclient project based upon its released
version 0.17.0. For prior changes, see the change log of the
python-zhmcclient project.

Additional changes:

* Fixed the issue that the readline module is not available in
  standard python on Windows, by using the pyreadline module
  in that case.

* Fixed a flawed setup of setuptools in Python 2.7 on the Travis CI, where
  the metadata directory of setuptools existed twice, by adding a script
  `remove_duplicate_setuptools.py` that removes the moot copy of the metadata
  directory (python-zhmcclient issue #434).

* Added the version of the zhmcclient package to the output of
  ``zhmc --version``.
